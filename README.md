# PredictEngineFailures

### **Problem Statement and Objective**

Bird Strikes, defined as collisions between a bird and a moving aircraft, pose material threats to airplane passengers and hardware. Specifically, engine failure(s) caused by bird strikes, can be extremely dangerous to modern aircraft due to the common twin-engine design.  Since 1988, bird strikes have killed 280+ people and destroyed 260+ aircraft worldwide, resulting in an estimated $670M+ in direct aircraft repair costs (4,000+ reports indicate an average of over $150K/incident). Currently, pilots in civil aviation lack insight into the likelihood or risk levels of an engine failure due to a bird strike; therefore, they are unable to take proper precautionary measures to protect their passengers and aircraft. This is compounded by:

  * the growing use of turbofan engines 
  * the increase of air traffic around the world, and 
  * the lack of modern-day turbofan engine testing against a growing population of large birds. 
    
All of these considerations contribute to the major concerns and substantial risks that  an increase in future bird strikes will result in an increase of engine failure(s).  

##### **Our analysis consists of four sections:**

    * Conducting exploratory analysis on our dataset to determine patterns, imputations, causality, and/or correlation between variables 
    
    * Determining the variables that are statistically significant to our target variable, the likelihood or probability of engine failure in the event of a bird strike
    
    * Estimating the performance of various prediction models based on defined evaluation metrics
    
    * Predicting the likelihood or probability of engine failure utilizing the best performing prediction models
